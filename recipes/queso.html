        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This item is a relic of the dark days of British culinary history. Called "the most insipid sandwich in existence," the toast sandwich is a slice of toast compressed between two pieces of bread.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place a very thin piece of cold toast between two slices of thin bread-and-butter in the form of a sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper and salt. This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast.
